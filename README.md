In order to launch WebDriverAgent, your macOS will need to have Carthage installed
(Not needed for automation on Android)

Step 9 : Initialize WebDriverAgent Project 
On Terminal CD to WebDriverAgent Folder
WebDriverAgent will be found in : 
/path/where/installed/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent

For Appium Desktop :
/Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent

For Appium Installed through node :
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent
Mkdir -p Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle./Script/bootstrap.sh -d

Note : this command needs Carthage to be installed
Go to Folder on MacOS = Command + Shift + G

If you don’t found which the position, you can go to terminal and type 
which appium

If you not yet install appium through node
Type this on terminal command :

This is after complete all setting, you can check all setting is already done on macOS, with this command on Terminal
```sh
vi ~/.bash_profile
```

Configure Emulator/Virtual Device
1. open Android Studio
2. Create new Project (just dummy project)
3. After all file loaded, choose Tools menu → AVD Manager and SDK Manager
4. Click AVD Manager, then will show Your Virtual Device
5. Choose Create Virtual Device
6. Select what kind device you need
7. Click Next and if you don’t have virtual device you need, you can choose download first
8. Create AVD Name (any AVD name you like)
9. Finish

Add Other Editor
Install Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA


## Plugins
...
Install TestNG Plug In on Eclipse
1. Go to Help menu —→ Eclipse Marketplace
2. Search/Find TestNG (TestNG for Eclipse)
3. Install and Restart Eclipse after Install success

DO NOT SKIP - Important Note on dependencies version compatibility
Please go through below checklist and make sure you have correct configurations. If not you will run into issues
1.  Node version minimum should be 16. you can check your version with below command
node -v
If it is less than 16, please upgrade
2.  use latest Appium Server 2.0 version. If you use older Version 1.22, then you will run into issues.
If you have less than 2 version, use below steps to install correctly
```sh
npm uninstall -g appium
Delete  appium folder in node modules
npm install -g appium@next
```
3.  Appium Java client 8.0.0 has few bugs. So please select the  version Greater than 8.0.0 from mavenrepository.com. ( Always select latest available)
4.  Do not include any Selenium dependencies as of now in your project, I will later show what packages needs to be installed once we move into framework lectures,
5.  If you use Mac, check for profile using bash profile or -zsh, if your Mac use -zsh so you need set JAVA HOME and ANDROID HOME on -zsh, with this command open ~/.zprofile
edit and save, then run this command : source ~/.zprofile

## Development
So, as of now,  Below is Latest perfect working ( Appium & TestNG ) Combination  which you can have in your POM.xml Project for smoother execution 
<dependency>
<groupId>io.appium</groupId>
<artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
<version>8.5.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
<version>7.8.0</version>
</dependency>

Install Appium Driver
check available driver on Terminal :
```sh
appium driver list
```
So you need uiautomator2 driver to automate your android device or emulator
for install is simply just use this command :
```sh
appium driver install uiautomator2
```
for IOS Automate just install xcuitest 


#Instructions for local execution
How to run Appium on your Mac
1. Open Appium Inspector and Set Up Appium Inspector
Remote Host = 127.0.0.1
Remote Port =4723
Remote Path =/wd/hub

2. Set Desired Capabilities on Appium Inspector
for example :
{
  "platformName": "Android",
  "appium:deviceName": "Pixel 5 API 32",
  "appium:app": "/Users/indochatqa1/Downloads/facebook.apk",
  "appium:automationName": "UIAutomator2",
  "appium:platformVersion": "12.0",
  "appium:noReset": true
}

Save your Desired Capabilities for next run

For reference about Desired Capabilities, please read on this doc :
https://appium.io/docs/en/2.0/guides/caps/

3. Open Appium (Appium Server)
Set on General
Server Address set to : 127.0.0.1 (for local host)
Server Port : 4723

don’t forget for Edit Configurations, set Environment Variables for ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME
ANDROID_HOME = /Users/indochatqa1/Library/Android/sdk
JAVA_HOME = /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_192.jdk/Contents/Home/bin

Check for that path, for same Laptop/PC or OS (Windows) maybe will have different path for this.
After Set this Path, click Save and Restart Appium Server.

If you still wrong for set ANDROID_HOME or JAVA_HOME, will show error message.

4. Open Android Studio
After Android Studio opened, please 
* Create new project 
* Download ADB for Android Emulator/Virtual Device
* Create Emulator, choose the device and Run the emulator
for this i use Pixel 3a API 32

prepare for sample .apk for test running on Appium and for get the element of some mobile applications.

5. Check Appium Server, if server already running and Android Studio for Emulator already running. then now Start Session on Appium Inspector

After all 3 apps is running well, we can start to find the element, send Keys, Click etc on Appium Inspector
for example on this video :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15b0oihncMzSBX9WLerMG2T2YIOtYMaNQ/view?usp=share_link
we can start Recording for each step and get the element
